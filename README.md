Frontend (React):
Main Interface (App.js): The central hub of your React application, which is responsible for displaying articles and providing an interface to create new ones.
Users can add new articles via text inputs for the title, content, and author.
A list of articles is displayed, each with options to update the title and content or to delete the article.
The interface is styled with CSS for a clean and user-friendly layout, with text fields and buttons for interactions.
Article Component (Article.js): Represents individual articles in the blog.
Includes the article's title, content, and author.
Provides "Update" and "Delete" buttons, allowing users to edit or remove articles from the list.

Backend (Express and MongoDB):
The server provides API endpoints for CRUD operations (server.js).
Create: POST requests to add new articles.
Read: GET requests to retrieve all articles or a single article by ID.
Update: PUT requests to modify existing articles.
Delete: DELETE requests to remove articles.
Database (MongoDB): Stores articles with fields for title, content, and author.

Functionality:
The application is interactive, with the ability to dynamically add, update, and delete content without page reloads.
The React state and effect hooks are used to manage state and side effects, like fetching data from the server.

Development Setup:
Runs locally with the frontend (React) on localhost:3000 and the backend (Express) on localhost:5050.
Employs axios for HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Express backend.

Potential Enhancements:
User authentication to allow for personalized blogging experiences.
Enhanced text editing capabilities for article content.
Commenting functionality for each article.
Search and filtering options to easily navigate through the articles.
Visual Elements: Includes an animated logo and a color scheme that offers a professional and modern aesthetic.
